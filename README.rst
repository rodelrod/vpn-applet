VPN Applet
==========

Runs a Unity app indicator that allows to connect and disconnect a pre-configured IPSec/L2TP VPN client.

This applet is intended for strictly personal use and won't do anything for you without a lot of configuration.

It runs on Ubuntu 12.04 with OpenSwan, xl2tpd and ppp. It probably won't run anywhere else.

Even the name of the VPN is hard-coded.

To configure the VPN itself, check `Jacco de Leeuw's guide`_.

Run ``register_icon.sh`` to... guess what... register the icon.
